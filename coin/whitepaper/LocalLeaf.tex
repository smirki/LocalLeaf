\begin{abstract}
    LocalLeaf is a loyalty point system based on blockchain technology. It aims to provide a secure and transparent way for customers to earn and redeem loyalty points at participating stores. In this whitepaper, we describe the technical details of LocalLeaf, including its architecture, consensus mechanism, and transaction process.

\section{Introduction}

Loyalty point systems have been around for decades, but they are often criticized for being complicated, confusing, and insecure. LocalLeaf addresses these issues by using blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent loyalty point system.

\section{Architecture}

LocalLeaf is built on a blockchain network that uses the proof of work consensus mechanism. The blockchain consists of blocks that are linked together in a chain, with each block containing a list of transactions.

\subsection{Block Structure}

Each block in the LocalLeaf blockchain contains the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Block header}: A fixed-size field that contains the block's metadata, including its version number, timestamp, and nonce.
    \item \textbf{Transaction list}: A variable-length list that contains the transactions included in the block.
    \item \textbf{Previous block hash}: A fixed-size field that contains the hash of the previous block in the chain.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transaction Process}

When a customer makes a purchase at a participating store, they earn LocalLeaf tokens based on the value of their purchase. These tokens are stored in the customer's LocalLeaf wallet.

To redeem their tokens, customers can use the LocalLeaf payment gateway at participating stores. The payment gateway converts the tokens into the store's local currency at the current exchange rate.

\section{Conclusion}

LocalLeaf provides a secure and transparent way for customers to earn and redeem loyalty points at participating stores. By using blockchain technology, it ensures that all transactions are recorded on a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger.
